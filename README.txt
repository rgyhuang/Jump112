# 112JUMP

## What is 112Jump?
112Jump is based on the popular mobile game Doodle Jump. Players control a jumping character (referred to as the Doodle) and navigate it through a never-ending series of platforms. The Doodle must jump onto these platforms, some of which have special properties, and must avoid falling off of the screen or bumping into monsters. As the Doodle goes higher and higher, the playerâ€™s score increases and the levels get more challenging. Players can save their high scores and compete with others to claim the title of 112Jump!
